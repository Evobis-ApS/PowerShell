# Evobis PowerShell

A public facing PowerShell 7.x Framework to streamline collaboration with our clients. 

These cmdlets aren't meant to be used for automations, but rather as a way to provide a consistent and easy to use interface for our clients to interact Microsoft Services.

## Installation/Getting started

The solution isn't a "module" in the sense that you don't install it on your machine. Instead you just run it from the repository, when needed, and then it's only available in the current session.

To use it, simply run the following command in a PowerShell session:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evobis-ApS/PowerShell/refs/heads/main/main.ps1 | iex
```

## Cmdlets

There are loads of service cmdlets available, those aren't intended to be used directly, but are instead called via the other cmdlets, the following are the ones intended for 'public usage'.

### Add-EBPermissionsToManagedIdentity

This cmdlet is used to add permissions to a managed identity.

#### Example

```powershell
Add-EBPermissionsToManagedIdentity -ManagedIdentityObjectId "b8ef0ce0-2e99-4950-8bfd-713fb0ce810a" -SharePointScopes Sites.FullControl.All -GraphScopes Directory.Read.All, Mail.Send
```

#### Parameters

- `-ManagedIdentityObjectId`: The object id of the managed identity.
- `-SharePointScopes`: The SharePoint scopes to add, these support autocomplete of the possible scopes, and allow multiple, simply by separating them with a `,`.
- `-GraphScopes`: The Graph scopes to add, these support autocomplete of the possible scopes, and allow multiple, simply by separating them with a `,`.

### Add-EBSitesSelectedPermissionToSite

This cmdlet allows you to grant an application access to a single SharePoint site, this is useful when you want to grant access to a site, rather than using the all mighty `Sites.FullControl.All`, but instead the `Sites.Selected`.

#### Example

```powershell
Add-EBSitesSelectedPermissionToSite -ClientId "b8ef0ce0-2e99-4950-8bfd-713fb0ce810a" -SiteUrl "https://evobisdev.sharepoint.com/sites/DTTest" -Permission read
```

#### Parameters

- `-ClientId`/`-ObjectId`: The ClientId of the application, or the ObjectId of the managed identity.
- `-SiteUrl`: The URL of the site to grant access to, without any trailing slashes.
- `-Permission`: The permission to grant, this can be `read`, `write`
