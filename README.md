# Evobis PowerShell

A public facing PowerShell 7.x Framework to streamline collaboration with our clients. 

These cmdlets aren't meant to be used for automations, but rather as a way to provide a consistent and easy to use interface for our clients to interact Microsoft Services.

# Installation/Getting started

The solution isn't a "module" in the sense that you don't install it on your machine. Instead you just run it from the repository, when needed, and then it's only available in the current session.

To use it, simply run the following command in a PowerShell session:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Evobis-ApS/PowerShell/refs/heads/main/main.ps1 | iex
```
